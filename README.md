# encryption-decryption
	Encryption is the process of translating plain text data into something that appears to be random and meaningless(ciphertext). Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext.

	To encrypt more than a small amount of data, symmetric encryption is used. A symmetric key is used during both the encryption and decryption process. To decrypt a particular piece of ciphertext, the key that was used to encrypt the data must be used.

	This program uses features of object-oriented programming and file handling for better encryption and decryption system.

Program Structure:
	The program consists of four steps
		* First it shows the menu 
		* Then it get input of the string for encrypton or decryption 
		* Get input of the password for encryption or decryption
		* Finally shows user the output string
